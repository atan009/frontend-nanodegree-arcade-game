# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game - Alex Tan

This is a project that I did for the frontend nanodegree program from Udacity.

If you would like to do this yourself, check out this [Repo](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

## 1. How to Run
Upon downloading these files/repository, open frontend-nanodegree-game folder.<br>
Inside the folder, open the index.html with any web browser.<br>
This should automatically start the game.<br>

## 2. How to Play
The only goal is to get the player to the river.<br>
Use the arrow keys to control the character.<br>
Up, Down, Left and Right moves the character in the respective direction.<br>
If touched by a bug, the character will be sent to the start.<br>
Upon reaching the river, a victory message will be logged into the console which can be seen by inspecting the open page.
